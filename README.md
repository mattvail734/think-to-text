In this project we attempt to develop a consumer brain-computer interface using consumer electronics. We will monitor electrical activity in the brain using electroencephalogram (EEG) and use that signal to reproduce a user's thoughts in real-time. The user's mind will be read and their thoughts transformed to text.
